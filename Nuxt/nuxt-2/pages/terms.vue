        <p>little Paul, Paul the mouse, I call him, wants to rule Arrakis. 
          many are saying this, but we can't let that happen, folks, can we? no, 
          we'll make Arrakis great again and Paul and his worm ridersâ€”they're riding the worms now, 
          many such cases. but we won't let them stop us.</p>
